People write for different reasons.

Some people write to become a better communicator, to tell stories, to help others, to change lives, to innovate, to relax, to connect, to be part of something bigger than themselves, to be less self-conscious, to make money.

Some reasons are better than others.

Why do I write? To think clearer, to create, to press publish. It changes with time.

But my favorite parts of writing consistently have nothing to do with why I started. Writing hijacks your mindset to make you more positive. Regardless of how bad of a day you're having, it's hard to be negative in your writing. Something about writing it down makes you realize, it's not so serious.

And your writing is your thoughts. You can't help but shape your actions around it. The best part? Anyone can do it. I'm not a great writer. In fact, as a kid I hated writing because I was so bad, but that's okay. Even if no one ever reads what you write, you can start bringing positivity into the world and your life today.

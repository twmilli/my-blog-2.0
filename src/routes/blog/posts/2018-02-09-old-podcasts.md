We live in an age with constant updates. Streaming has prevailed over downloaded content. An incredible amount of new podcasts, medium articles, and YouTube videos are created every day.

I think by constantly consuming brand new content I more easily slip into a pattern of short-term thinking. The content of today might not be relevant a year from now. Recently I've been enjoying consuming old podcasts that discuss topics that are still clearly relevant today.

Sure, the bitcoin and blockchain podcasts of today might be more relevant, but there's something special about hearing Andreas Antonopolous talk about bitcoin in 2015 during [this](https://softwareengineeringdaily.com/2015/08/14/bitcoin-with-andreas-antonopoulos/) podcast episode.

Going back in time forces me to focus on the fundamentals, rather than the fleeting news stories or hot topics of today. Of course, old podcasts are only one example. Books date back much further than podcasts, yet many of them still stand the test of time. Try it out, see what you think. That new medium article can wait.

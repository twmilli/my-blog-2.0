Two of my favorite books, Rich Dad Poor Dad by Robert Kiyosaki and Four Hour Work Week by Tim Ferriss are often criticized for leaving out important details and engaging in hyperbole.

These claims are warranted, but that's not the point.

Although exaggerated at times, the narratives of the authors are rooted in their own personal experiences, and they are encouraging the reader to engage in activities that have the potential to be life enhancing.

It's true that Robert Kiyosaki skips over all of the things that can go wrong with real estate investing, but that's not his goal. His goal is to get readers excited about investing, and the opportunities available. If you're focused on all of the problems that might arise, chances are you'll never start.

Tim Ferriss makes starting a business and quitting your job to travel the world sound easy. It won't be, but if the book presented a more accurate depiction of all of the hardships involved, you might never try.

The takeaway here is to get started. The more you know, the less you do. No matter how much research you do, you're likely to run into roadblocks along the way.

The real learning and research starts the day you get started. Today could be that day.

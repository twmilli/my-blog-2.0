I tell myself that my addiction to doing is healthy. Maybe it is. After all, life is short, momento mori. I'm ambitious, and I tell myself it's because I want to make a difference in the world.

I tell myself that my addiction to doing is healthy. Maybe it is. After all, life is short, [momento mori](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memento_mori). I'm ambitious, and I tell myself it's because I want to make a difference in the world.

Society loves ambitious people. But I think, in reality, I'm doing it for the excitement more than anything else. Thinking about business, technology and making money is exciting to me, and so I follow this excitement.

But what if I didn't need it? What if I could find excitement in each day without these pursuits?

Would I enjoy the little things more? Would I build stronger relationships?

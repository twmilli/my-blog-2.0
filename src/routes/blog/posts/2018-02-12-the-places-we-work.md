As I type this, I'm sitting on top of two bean bag chairs in the basement of the library.

For many, this might seem like a strange, if not terrible place to work. It looks like a napping area more than anything else. Depending on what I'm doing, it might be a terrible place for me to work too.

As I type this, I'm sitting on top of two bean bag chairs in the basement of the library.

For many, this might seem like a strange, if not terrible place to work. It looks like a napping area more than anything else. Depending on what I'm doing, it might be a terrible place for me to work too.

But I've built entire websites sitting in these bean bag chairs. I learned react native and starting hacking on my [Smitten Kitchen](https://github.com/twmilli/smitten-kitchen) mobile app in these bean bag chairs. There was a semester where I came here almost every Monday, Wednesday, and Friday for an hour to focus on my own side projects.

The places we work matter. They can be the difference between a productive hour, and an hour spent mindlessly browsing the web. Good places to work take time to craft. The more good work we do somewhere, the better it becomes. I think people are trying to figure this out. It's likely part of why WeWork has been so successful. Their entire business is helping yet up productive work environments.

Will virtual reality change this? Honestly, I don't know. Our gut instinct is to say no. How else to the physical buildings we spend our days in the impact our lives?

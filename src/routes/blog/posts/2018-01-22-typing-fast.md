I type fast. Many of my thoughts are half baked. I rarely spend much time editing. Usually I just pop my writing into grammarly, make a few corrections, then it's done.

I type fast. Many of my thoughts are half baked. I rarely spend much time editing. Usually I just pop my writing into [grammarly](https://app.grammarly.com/), make a few corrections, then it's done.

I do this not because I believe that this is the best way to write, but because I've found that the more I remove friction, the more often I write.

I don't write because I have it all figured out, but rather to actively think about these topics. I'm sure I will change my mind about a lot of what I write, but that's not the point. Maybe I will even change my mind on the usefulness of typing fast.

I think developing a thesis and being wrong is better than having no thesis at all. A bias towards action, even if it means being wrong.

Editing has a place, but so do typos. Many of us spend too much time trying to find the typos.

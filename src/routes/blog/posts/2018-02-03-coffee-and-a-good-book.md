Sitting down to coffee and a good book is one of my favorite indulgences.

It's a simple act, but it's something I relish and look forward to, especially on the weekends. For me, it's the perfect excuse to be present. When I am reading, I am fully immersed in the story and words that the author has spent months (or years) crafting for my reading pleasure.

When I sip my coffee I think about the months required to grow the beans, the miles of travel necessary to get to me, and all the steps in between. I also think about how much I love the taste of good coffee :).

In this incredibly complex world, simple pleasures are often still the most comforting. But they are also the easiest to overlook. There are a million other things in my life as incredible as coffee and a good book that I overlook all the time. Music, laptops, the wind in your face. We're surrounded. We live in an amazing time. Find an excuse to be grateful today.

"Drinking is borrowing happiness from tomorrow" - Matt Mullenweg
Similarly, I think many "type A" people, including myself have a tendency to borrow happiness from today, in hopes of happiness in the future.

I love this quote. Similarly, I think many "type A" people, including myself have a tendency to borrow happiness from today, in hopes of happiness in the future.

We call it delayed gratification. Long-term thinking. Society praises this delayed gratification and criticizes the short-term thinking of alcohol consumption. But nothing you do today will make you happy tomorrow, and nothing you do tomorrow will make you happy today.

There is a place for both these things. I personally love to drink alcohol on occasion. I love to dream about the future and work hard to make these dreams come true. But in excess, both are extraordinarily dangerous. I'd rather just be high on today.

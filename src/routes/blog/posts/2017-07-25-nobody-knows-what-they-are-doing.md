The more I learn, about anything, the more I realize that no one actually knows what they're doing.

It could be life, programming, starting a business, building a strong relationship, it almost doesn't matter.

The more I learn, about anything, the more I realize that no one actually knows what they're doing.

It could be life, programming, starting a business, building a strong relationship, it almost doesn't matter.

At first, this can be terrifying.

What do you mean no one at Braintree fully understands how millions of dollars get moved around each day?

What should I do when I find out that someone I look up to is actually just making it up along the way?

After you get over the initial shock of this realization, it's liberating. If the people you think have all the answers are making mistakes every day, it frees you to do the same.

Reading and learning from others is essential, but it's not a substituion for doing. Loads of people know more than me, but they're still making mistakes and learning every day. After all, no one actually knows what they're doing.

The only way to get somewhere is to start.

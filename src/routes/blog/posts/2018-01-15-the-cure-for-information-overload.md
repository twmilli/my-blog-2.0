The internet is incredible. It's led to a mindblowing amount of content creation.

Want to learn something? The options are endless. YouTube, Podcasts, Medium Articles....the list goes on. It's led to a massive democratization of information, but not necessarily a democratization of knowledge.

In this new age of media at our fingertips, it's easy to feel overwhelmed. There is always something new to learn, a news article, or an episode of our favorite podcast to consume. We're consuming more content than ever before, but what are we actually learning from it.

Sometimes, I think the solution is to be more mindful and limit our consumption habits. Tim Ferriss has coined the term [low information diet](https://tim.blog/category/low-information-diet-and-selective-ignorance/) for this practice.

More often, however, I think the feeling of overwhelming comes from consuming all of this information, and not doing anything with it.

Maybe we're not consuming too much, but rather creating too little.

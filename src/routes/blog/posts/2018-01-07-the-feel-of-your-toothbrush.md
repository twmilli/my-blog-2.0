When you wake up, brushing your teeth is likely one of the first things you do. If you're like me, by the time your toothbrush is in your mouth, your mind is already wandering. Thinking about the day, what you want to do, what you have to do, your dog, or what you'll have for breakfast (unless you're a post-breakfast brusher of course). Sometimes I can't even remember if I already brushed my teeth minutes later because I was so distracted.

_This post was inspired but [this](https://www.farnamstreetblog.com/the-knowledge-project/) podcast with [Naval Ravikant](https://twitter.com/naval?lang=en)._

If you haven't listened to this podcast, I'd highly recommend it. It's easily one of my favorites of 2017.

But why? The day will come, things will get done -- or they won't but playing your day in your head probably won't help you. So the next time you brush your teeth, try to catch yourself. Enjoy the feeling of the brush touching up against your gums. Appreciate the fact that you even have a toothbrush. And running water. It sounds weird but just try it.

You might be surprised by how good it feels to truly feel your toothbrush in your mouth. To be present. At the very least you'll probably do a better job brushing your teeth :).

Today I'm in Vermont at Mount Snow for what promises to be a great day of snowboarding.

It's days like these that make me incredibly happy and thankful to be alive. I try to appreciate every day, but there's something special that comes with breaking your routine, and spending a day outdoors with friends.

Today I'm in Vermont at Mount Snow for what promises to be a great day of snowboarding.

It's days like these that make me incredibly happy and thankful to be alive. I try to appreciate every day, but there's something special that comes with breaking your routine, and spending a day outdoors with friends.

In the past I've sometimes been hesitant to break away from my routine. A 6 hour drive to Vermont for a weekend? That's insane. I won't have any time to work on personal projects or go to the gym. This is silly.

Doing this trip every weekend would be neither sustainable nor enjoyable. But there's a magic that comes when I completely break my routine. The powder is always worth it. What's your powder?

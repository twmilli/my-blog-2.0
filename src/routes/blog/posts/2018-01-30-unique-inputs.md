To be a great painter, you need to see the world in a way no one else does.

To identify a financial bubble, you need to see something everyone else overlooks.

To start a great business, you need to believe in a dream that few others believe in. And then convince others to make your dreams come true. The founders of Airbnb were multiple years in with over 50k of credit card debt before they closed their first round of funding.

To be world class at almost anything requires contrarian thinking, not for the sake of contradiction, but out of genuine belief. Paradoxically, many people believe there is a road path that you can follow that will take you to greatness, it just requires the hard work to follow this path.

Unique outputs require unique inputs. It's not enough to try to think differently, you have to live differently.

I'm planning on attending a 10-day silent retreat in Thailand this coming summer. Why? Honestly, I have no idea, but it sounds super interesting. If you ever needed an excuse to do something crazy or weird, let this post be it. Outlier outcomes require outlier experiences.

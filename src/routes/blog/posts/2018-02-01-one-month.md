Let's take a moment to pause. How is your year going?

I think reflection is hugely underrated. But only in the sense that we all know we should do it, but very few of us take the time to actually do it in practice. It's part of why I've enjoyed writing every day so much. It gives me a few moments to reflect every day.

Over the past month, I've hit publish 29 out of 31 days. Just by spending a few minutes writing every day, I've written a total of 8742 words. 52633 characters. This first month of writing daily was an experiment. But I'm happy to say I'll be extending it.

I feel so incredibly lucky to be alive during this time in history. Huge things are happening, especially in the world of [blockchain](https://medium.freecodecamp.org/the-authoritative-guide-to-blockchain-development-855ab65b58bc). I'm excited to see what the next 11/12 of 2018 will bring. Let's make it count :). Thanks for being here.

Prior to watching the video, I'd never even heard of the Faroe Islands. It's about halfway between Norway and Iceland, which is to say it's smack dab in the middle of nowhere.

A few weeks ago a friend sent me this video about the [Faroe Islands](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Faroe_Islands) made by [Danny Gevirtz](http://dannygevirtz.com/):

The video perfectly captures the reasons I love to travel. Going somewhere completely new, in the middle of nowhere, and spending time with people you care about.

While I hope to visit the Faroe islands one day, you don't need an expensive plane ticket to go on an adventure with people you care about. We're surrounded by adventures. It's up to us to be daring enough to take the road that no one even knows about.

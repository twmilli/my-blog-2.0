    When I graduated from highschool, I was 17 and had no idea what I wanted to
    do with my life. So I took a gap year. A year later, I still had no idea
    what I wanted to do.
  </p>
  <p>
    So... I went to college (@ Bucknell). Ended up majoring in Chemical
    Engineering, falling in love with computer science along the way, and
    eventually breaking into the industry with an internship at Braintree. It's
    a long story, I wrote all about it

      here.

    Recently, I've been working on the targeting team at
    <a href="https://www.thumbtack.com/">Thumbtack</a>
    . We build tools to help service professionals on our platform get the jobs
    that they want.

    I have no idea what the next few years will bring, but I hope to stay
    passionate about whatever I'm working on, and hopefully make the world just
    a little bit better in the process. If you want to contact me, feel free to
    email me at twm013@bucknell.edu.
